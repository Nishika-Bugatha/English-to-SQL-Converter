Natural Language to SQL with T5 and Spider Dataset
Project Overview
This project aims to convert natural language queries into SQL queries using the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model. The T5 model is a versatile transformer-based model designed to handle a variety of text-to-text tasks, including translating natural language into SQL queries.

Objectives
Natural Language to SQL Translation: Train the T5 model to understand and generate SQL queries from natural language questions.
Utilize Spider Dataset: Employ the Spider dataset, a comprehensive benchmark that includes diverse and complex SQL queries across multiple database schemas, to ensure the model's robustness and generalization.
Dataset
The project uses the Spider dataset, which is renowned for its complexity and cross-domain nature. The dataset consists of:

Natural Language Questions: Phrases or sentences in English that describe database queries.
SQL Queries: Structured queries corresponding to the natural language questions.
Database Schemas: Information about various databases including tables, columns, and relationships.
Model
T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) is used for this project. T5 treats every text processing task as a text-to-text problem, allowing it to be trained on a wide range of NLP tasks, including translating natural language into SQL.

Training and Evaluation
Training: The T5 model is fine-tuned on the Spider dataset to learn the mapping from natural language queries to SQL queries. This involves processing the dataset to teach the model to generate SQL queries from given questions.
Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated to assess its performance in generating accurate SQL queries. Evaluation metrics may include query accuracy, execution accuracy, and the modelâ€™s ability to handle diverse and complex queries.
Use Cases
Database Query Generation: The primary use case is to automatically generate SQL queries from user input in natural language. This can be useful in applications that need to interface with databases using user-friendly language.
Query Understanding: Enhances the ability of systems to understand and process user queries expressed in natural language, making database interactions more intuitive.
Expected Outcomes
Enhanced User Interaction: Simplifies the interaction between users and databases by enabling natural language queries.
Robust Model: A T5 model trained on the Spider dataset capable of handling diverse queries across various database schemas.
